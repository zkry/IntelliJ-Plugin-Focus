# Focus Time Tracker IntelliJ Plugin

Focus Time Tracker is a minimalist Pomodoro like time tracker. It sits in the status bar, and has a simple UI.

## Purpose

The "Pomodoro" technique has been used and loved my many. It is a productivity tactic whereby one allocates a block of time,
usually 25 minutes, and only works on one specific project. During this time, all other distractions should be eliminated such
as social media or phones. I have personally found this technique to work for me very well. If you find yourself having a hard time
starting a project you could try the following: tell yourself that you will work for only one 25 minute session and after that, if
you want you may stop working. Start the timer and start working. At the end of the session you might find yourself ready to work
well above the planned 25 minute session. There is a lot more written on this subject that you can read up on.

## Usage

The usage for this extension is simple and easy to understand. The plugin works as follows:

- An unstated session will have "Start Timer" written.
- When started, you will see the time left along with the pause and play signs.
- Click to start/pause.
- Double click to kill the session.
- After the session is done a 'break' session will start for 5 minutes. This can be killed as well.
- Under tools you may select "Focus Settings" to change the duration of a session. (Default is 25 minutes)
- Hover mouse over widget to see how many sessions you have completed. The count will reset after 7 hours of inactivity.
